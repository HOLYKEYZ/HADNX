# Exploitation Phase - Proof-Based Verification

## Objective
Systematically and exhaustively weaponize every potential vulnerability provided. Pursue each to a definitive conclusion: either confirm exploitability and achieve impact, or prove with rigorous testing it is not exploitable.

## PROOF-BASED EXPLOITATION REQUIREMENTS

### Core Principles
- **Claims require evidence**: Every exploitation claim must be backed by demonstrable proof
- **Assumptions must be validated**: Test every assumption before building on it
- **Failures must be documented**: Create detailed reports for learning
- **Default to skepticism**: Assume NOT vulnerable until proven otherwise
- **Partial results are not complete**: Be honest about what you achieved vs attempted

**Remember:** An unproven vulnerability is worse than no finding at all.

## EXPLOITATION TARGET
**All exploitation MUST be performed against: {{WEB_URL}}**

## RIGOROUS VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### Honesty About Execution
- Do NOT claim XSS works without JavaScript actually executing
- "Reflected in HTML" is NOT the same as "JavaScript executed"
- Partial payload reflection without execution = BLOCKED

### Proof of Exploitation Levels

| Level | Evidence | Classification |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Level 1 | Payload reflected but encoded/sanitized | NOT VULNERABLE |
| Level 2 | Payload in HTML but JS blocked by filters/CSP | POTENTIAL (requires bypass) |
| Level 3 | JavaScript executes (alert, console.log, DOM) | EXPLOITED |
| Level 4 | Session hijacking, data theft, unauthorized actions | EXPLOITED (CRITICAL) |

**You MUST reach Level 3 with evidence to mark as "EXPLOITED"**

## Graph-Based Exploitation Methodology

**Core Concept:** Every vulnerability is a graph traversal problem.
- **Nodes:** Source → Processing → Sanitization → Sink
- **Edges:** Data flow connections
- **Mission:** Craft payloads that exploit each node's characteristics

### Stage 1: Initialize & Understand Targets
For each vulnerability in queue:
1. Read the analysis finding
2. Understand the specific sink context
3. Identify known security controls

### Stage 2: Engineer & Execute Payloads
- Start with basic payloads for the vulnerability class
- Iterate with bypass techniques
- Maximum 5 payloads per test run
- Document each attempt and result

### Stage 3: Achieve Impact & Document
- For successful exploits: capture evidence
- For blocked attempts: document bypass failures
- Classify according to Proof Levels

## Bypass Exhaustion Protocol

Before marking anything as NOT EXPLOITABLE:
1. Try at least 5 different bypass techniques
2. Test encoding variations
3. Check for context-specific bypasses
4. Document all failed attempts
5. Only then classify as BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY

## Impact Evidence Guidelines

### For XSS
- Screenshot of alert()
- Console log capture
- Cookie exfiltration proof

### For Injection
- Database error messages
- Data retrieval proof
- Command execution output

### For Auth/AuthZ
- Access to unauthorized resource
- Privilege escalation proof
- Session manipulation evidence

### For SSRF
- Internal service response
- Metadata retrieval
- Port scan results

## Output Format

### Successfully Exploited Vulnerabilities
```
VULN-[TYPE]-[ID]: [Title]
- Target: {{WEB_URL}}/path
- Method: [Attack technique]
- Payload: [Exact payload used]
- Evidence: [Proof of execution]
- Impact: [What unauthorized action was achieved]
- Severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
```

### Potential Vulnerabilities (Blocked)
```

## Evidence Completeness Verification

Before submitting any exploitation report, verify:
- [ ] Every finding has a clear verdict
- [ ] All exploited vulns have proof
- [ ] All blocked vulns have bypass attempt logs
- [ ] No findings are left in ambiguous state
