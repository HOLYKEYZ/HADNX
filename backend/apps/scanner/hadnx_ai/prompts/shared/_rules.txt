**RULES TO AVOID FALSE POSITIVES:**

1. Do not confuse application validation errors (400s) with backend execution errors
2. Do not treat early sanitization as sufficient when later concatenation reintroduces taint
3. Do not mistake WAF blocking for proof of a flaw - document separately
4. Do not assume parameter binds protect SQL identifiers or keywords
5. Do not rely on generic regex/escaping for data value slots where binding is required
6. Do not assume blacklists of special characters are secure defenses
7. Distinguish between safe array-based command execution and unsafe string-based execution

**ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES:**
- Separate analysis and exploit phases - analysis proves reachability + mismatch only
- Record merge points where multiple sources feed one sink
- Label exact slot types at sinks to set correct defense expectations
- Document secure vectors to prevent re-testing (negative results matter)
